TODO

Enemies:
	Attack state
		-entered by being in "hunt" and player being inside an area2d "attack range".
		-for melee, should be as simple as playing "attack" animation, then checking distance to player again on finished
		-oh yeah, attack range should be in both direcitons, and just flip enemy the correct way before starting animation
		- for ranged, should be able to create a "launch projectile" function in each enemy. this could then be called in animation player
	
	Fix other enemies. should only need to copy paste state machine, pathfinder and playertargeter

-dashing out of level is a problem...

-spells for player
	-take a msg and transition to spell state
	-spell state is just play animation, ending when button no longer held
	-or when animation finished
-when selecting spell, icon pops in and fades out

-coyote for player


-use visual cues instead of health/mana bars
	-greyscale when low health for example
-physics objects like crates, deal damage when falling on things, can be pushed by player


MIGHT BE DONE:
	CALCULATE "jump_distance" CORRECTLY


BROKEN:
	enemy pathfinding, it just jumps when entering Alert
