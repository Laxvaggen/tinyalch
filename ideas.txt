-as long as enemy spawn tiles exist, unpathable cells also exist
-when there are no more enemy spawn tile, unpathable tiles can be removed
-REMEMBER TO ADD ERASE UNPATHABLES CALL TO LEVEL.GD
-enemies dont seem to care about unpathables anyway...

-pathfinding may get stuck in corners:
	-this is because it selects the nearest node to player, and then walks towards it until player gets further away,
	at which point it stops.
	-but then, if it is already at the nearest node, it wont pathfind
	-so i have to make it pathfind to nearest node to player, that is on the other side of player
	-or just append the position at the end of the path
	
	-this may be fixed right now, with "append(go_to)" in set_target of pathfinding_entity
