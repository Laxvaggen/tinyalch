Add coyote to player
Change stealth mechanic: enemie scan never spot player instantly
increase size of pause menu
music fade out

-sound
	-find good audio, use "play_sound_effect" in entities to play
-find when enemies no longer see player, and then switch back to standard ingame music
-on every "spotted player" signal received: add 1 to a score
-on every "lost player" signal received: subtract 1 from score
-if score changed to 0: play normal ingame music.
-if score changed and is above 0: play combat ingame music
(the way im doing it is probably VERY DUMB)


-controls: write up all controls

-visual feedback:
	-grayscale when low health (shader)
	-screenshake
-physics objects, just for decoration
	-crates
	-barrels

-can dash into small holes


-as long as enemy spawn tiles exist, unpathable cells also exist
-when there are no more enemy spawn tile, unpathable tiles can be removed
-REMEMBER TO ADD ERASE UNPATHABLES CALL TO LEVEL.GD
-enemies dont seem to care about unpathables anyway...

-pathfinding may get stuck in corners:
	-this is because it selects the nearest node to player, and then walks towards it until player gets further away,
	at which point it stops.
	-but then, if it is already at the nearest node, it wont pathfind
	-so i have to make it pathfind to nearest node to player, that is on the other side of player
	-or just append the position at the end of the path
	
	-this may be fixed right now, with "append(go_to)" in set_target of pathfinding_entity
