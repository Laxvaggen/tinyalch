TODO

PLAYER:
	-coyote

-Buttons dont work?

FIX LIGHT OCCLUSION MAPPING IN TILEMAP: IT IS VERY NOTICEABLE WHEN IT DOESNT LINE UP WITH TILES
FIX LAMPLIGHT TEXTURE
ADD LAMPLIGHT SPRITE TEXTURE
ADD LAMPLIGHT AS TILE IN TILEMAP
ADD TEXTURE TO UNPATHABLE TILE: IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE RIGHT NOW
MAYBE POSSIBLE TO ADD RAYCAST EXCEPTION TO SPECIFIC TILES IN TILEMAP? IF SO, POSSIBLE TO LET LIGHT THROUGH PLATFORMS
ADD MODIFIER ON "get_distance_to_player" FUNCTION
MAKE BASE STATES; SOME ARE VERY SIMILAR


THEN ITS TIME FOR STATE MACHINES

-when selecting spell, icon pops in and fades out
-use visual cues instead of health/mana bars
-physics objects like crates, deal damage when falling on things, can be pushed by player


MIGHT BE DONE:
	CALCULATE "jump_distance" CORRECTLY
