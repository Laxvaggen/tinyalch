TODO

-dashing out of level is a problem... only if there is a floor tho

Enemies:
	Attack state
		-entered by being in "hunt" and player being inside an area2d "attack range".
		-for melee, should be as simple as playing "attack" animation, then checking distance to player again on finished
		-oh yeah, attack range should be in both direcitons, and just flip enemy the correct way before starting animation
		- for ranged, should be able to create a "launch projectile" function in each enemy. this could then be called in animation player
	
	Fix other enemies. should only need to copy paste state machine, pathfinder and playertargeter

-HUD (health)
-physics objects like crates, deal damage when falling on things, can be pushed by player

BROKEN:
	enemy pathfinding, it just jumps when entering Alert
