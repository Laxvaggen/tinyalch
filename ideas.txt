TODO

-can dash into small holes, and half holes

-pathfinding gets stuck in corners:
	-this is because it selects the nearest node to player, and then walks towards it until player gets further away,
	at which point it stops.
	-but then, if it is already at the nearest node, it wont pathfind
	-so i have to make it pathfind to nearest node to player, that is on the other side of player
	-or just append the position at the end of the path
	
	-this may be fixed right now, with "append(go_to)" in set_target of pathfinding_entity

-sound
-visual feedback:
	-grayscale when low health (shader)
	-screenshake
-physics objects like crates
